How to Use this Manual

The *VA FileMan ScreenMan Tutorial for Developers* is intended to help
VistA developers create ScreenMan forms using VA FileMan's Form Editor.
The Form Editor provides a major improvement in the speed and ease of
creating ScreenMan forms. The tutorial emphasizes the use of the Form
Editor in creating forms.

HTML Manuals

Why produce an HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) edition of the *VA
FileMan ScreenMan Tutorial for Developers*?

-   The HTML versions of the VA FileMan manuals are useful as online
    documentation support as you use VA FileMan. HTML manuals allow you
    to instantly jump (link) to specific sections or references online.

-   The VA FileMan HTML manuals are "living" documents that are
    continuously updated with the most current VA FileMan information
    (unlike paper or printed documentation). They are updated based on
    new versions, patches, or enhancements to VA FileMan.

-   Presenting manuals in an HTML format on a Web server also gives new
    opportunities, such as accessing embedded multimedia training
    material (e.g.,Â movies) directly in the manuals themselves.

-   Manuals are accessible over the VA Intranet network.

Intended Audience

The intended audience of this tutorial is all key stakeholders. The
stakeholders include:

-   Office of Information and Technology (OI&T)---VistA legacy
    development teams.

-   Information Resource Management (IRM)---System administrators at
    Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) sites who are responsible for
    computer management and system security on the VistA M Servers.

-   Health Product Support (HPS).

Legal Requirements

There are no special legal requirements involved in the use of VA
FileMan.

Objectives
----------

After completing this tutorial, you should have the skills to create a
ScreenMan interface to VA FileMan files. You will be able to:

-   Create a ScreenMan Form.

-   Add read-only fields to the form.

-   Add editable fields to the form.

-   Use the form editor to visually position fields on blocks.

-   Add additional pages to the form.

-   Edit multiples on the form (two methods).

-   Add ScreenMan computed fields and form-only fields to the form.

-   Edit fields in another file's related entries.

-   Use branching logic to jump from one field to another.

-   Turn the ScreenMan form into a Menu Manager option.

Files Used
----------

This tutorial needs the following files to be present in your test
account:

-   NEW PERSON (\#200)---Primary file; you add a ScreenMan form to it.

-   OPTION (\#19)---Form navigates to edit fields in this file.

-   SERVICE/SECTION (\#49)---Form navigates to edit fields in this file.

Advance Preparation
-------------------

This is a hands-on tutorial, requiring a safe (i.e.,Â *non*-production) M
account in which you can build a ScreenMan form.

The following software *must* be installed in the test account you use
for the tutorial:

-   VA FileMan 22.0

-   Kernel 8.0

This tutorial needs the following files to be present in your test
account:

-   NEW PERSON (\#200)---Primary file used by the tutorial; you add a
    ScreenMan form to it.

-   OPTION (\#19)---ScreenMan form navigates to edit fields in this
    file.

-   SERVICE/SECTION (\#49)---ScreenMan form navigates to edit fields in
    this file.

Kernel provides access to the ScreenMan options, as well as providing
the files for which you build a ScreenMan form during the tutorial.

You need to be granted the following privileges in the M test account
used for the tutorial:

-   The XUSCREENMAN security key.

-   A File Manager Access code of at-sign ("**@**").

It is further assumed that you have full, unrestricted programmer access
in this test account, including the ability to run any option and to add
options to your menu tree without supervision.

Each tutorial user should choose a unique namespace beginning with
**Z**, concatenated with two or three other letters (e.g.,Â Z*YXU*). Use
this namespace as the beginning of the names for all forms and blocks
that you create during this tutorial. Using your namespace protects the
system you are using from having existing forms and blocks overwritten.
This namespace is referred to as Z*xxx* during the tutorial.

Starting Out with Forms
=======================

This section of the tutorial shows you how to start building a form. It
demonstrates:

-   Initial building of a form.

-   How to add blocks to a form.

-   How to add simple fields to a block.

In this section of the tutorial, you will do the following:

-   [Create a Form]{.underline}.

-   [Add a DISPLAY Block to the Form]{.underline}.

-   [Add a Title (Caption-Only Field)]{.underline}.

-   [Reposition Fields on a Block]{.underline}.

-   [Add Data Dictionary Fields]{.underline}.

-   [Run the Form]{.underline}.

-   [Add an Edit Block to the Form]{.underline}.

-   [Add Data Dictionary Fields to the EDIT Block]{.underline}.

-   [Use PRINT\^DDS to List Form Characteristics]{.underline}.

Create a Form
-------------

### Overview

ScreenMan is a tool for screen-oriented, form-oriented data entry into
VA FileMan files. The Form Editor tool was introduced with VA FileMan
21.0. It assists developers in creating ScreenMan interfaces. This
tutorial concentrates on creating forms with the Form Editor.

In this tutorial, you will:

-   Create a form to edit entries in the NEW PERSON file (\#200).

![Note](images/media/image2.png){width="0.3125in" height="0.3125in"}
**NOTE:** You will *not* edit every field in the NEW PERSON file
(\#200), because that could be a big form!

-   Add selected fields from the NEW PERSON file (\#200) to the form, in
    such a way that you get experience using a variety of the features
    ScreenMan.

-   At the end of the tutorial, you will have built a form that is very
    similar to Kernel's Edit User Characteristics option (although your
    form edits a different set of fields).

#### ScreenMan Forms

When you create a form, a first page is created for the form by default.
You *cannot* place fields directly on either a form or page; you *must*
create blocks first. This is because the only place fields can be placed
on is a block. A block provides a place to logically group a set of
fields; you might edit a Multiple's fields in one block on one page, and
the top-level fields for the file on a block on another page. You can
also designate whether the fields on any given block are display-only or
editable.

[Figure 1]{.underline} shows the relationships with blocks, pages, and
forms:

[]{#_Ref390176444 .anchor}Figure . Relationships with blocks, pages, and
forms

Thus, to create a form, the first step is to create the form itself. The
first page of the form is created automatically when the form is
created. However, before you can add fields to the form, you *must* add
at least one block to the form. Adding a block to the form you create
will be your second step.

#### Form Editor

The most basic element in a ScreenMan form is the form itself. To create
the form, you use a tool called the Form Editor. You can invoke the Form
Editor from the following:

-   [Using the Edit/Create a Form Option]{.underline} \[DDS EDIT/CREATE
    A FORM\]

-   [Using the Direct Mode Utility]{.underline}

##### Using the Edit/Create a Form Option

From the **VA FileMan** main menu \[DIUSER**\]**, do the following:

1.  At the "Select VA FileMan Option:" prompt, select **Other Options**

##### Using the Direct Mode Utility

Alternatively, you can invoke the Form Editor from programmer mode using
the following direct-mode utility:

**D \^DDGF**

### Procedure

To create the first form, do the following:

1.  Invoke the Form Editor, using either the menu option (see [Figure
    > 2]{.underline}) or the direct-mode utility (see Section
    > [2.1.1.2.2]{.underline}).

2.  The first thing you are asked is for what file to create a form.
    > Since you are creating a form to edit the NEW PERSON file (\#200),
    > enter **NEW PERSON**.

3.  You are now asked for a form name. Entering two question marks
    > ("**??**") lists current forms defined for the NEW PERSON file
    > (\#200). Enter a new unique form name using your student namespace
    > concatenated with " **EDIT**". For example, if your namespace is
    > Z*YXU*, add a form called Z*YXU* EDIT.

![Note](images/media/image2.png){width="0.3125in" height="0.3125in"}
**NOTE:** From hereon in, the namespace part of a name is referred to as
"Z*xxx*" in the tutorial.

### Summary

In this lesson you learned how to create a ScreenMan form using the Form
Editor.

The Form Editor can be invoked with the Edit/Create a Form option, and
also with the direct-mode utility: **DÂ \^DDGF**.

Add a DISPLAY Block to the Form
-------------------------------

### Overview

The form you created in Section [2.1]{.underline} has a page (page 1 is
created by default), but no blocks yet. In order to add any fields to
the form, you need to place a block on the form. Thus, the first thing
to do with your form is to add a block.

There are two types of blocks:

-   **EDIT---**Allows fields to be changed by the user.

-   **DISPLAY---**Allows fields to be displayed but *not* changed by the
    user.

The cursor position, at the time you add a block, defines the region of
the block. The region of the page covered by the block starts at the
cursor position, and moves down and to the right. Thus, if the block
covers only the bottom half of the page, you are only able to place
fields on the bottom-half of that page (for that block only).

You can add more than one block on a page. The following are some
reasons why you might use more than one block on a page:

-   **Reusing Blocks---**You have a multi-page form, for example, and
    want the same header information on each page of the form. You can
    create a block for the header information only, and reuse the same
    block on each page of the form. Each page would then need an
    additional block for the fields unique to each page.

-   **Separate Blocks---**If fields on the same page come from different
    data dictionary file numbers (either from a Multiple, or from
    another file), you need to use separate blocks. You can only place
    fields from a single data dictionary file number on any given block.

![Note](images/media/image2.png){width="0.3125in" height="0.3125in"}
**NOTE:** Both of these situations are covered in subsequent sections in
this tutorial.

-   **Display-only Blocks---**You can make a field on an EDIT block
    "display-only" by individually setting that field's DISABLE EDITING
    property. You can have a large number of display-only fields, as
    well as some fields to edit, however. In this case, it can be easier
    to place the display-only fields on their own DISPLAY block, rather
    than set each field's DISABLE EDITING property.

### Procedure

In this section, you will add a single block to the page, and make it a
DISPLAY block.

To add a DISPLAY block, do the following:

1.  In the Form Editor, with your Z*xxx* EDIT form loaded, use the
    > **arrow keys** to position the cursor at row 1, column 1 if it is
    > *not* already at that position. This is the top-left corner on the
    > form.

**TIP:** Cursor Position:\
\
The current cursor position is always displayed at the lower-right
corner of the Form Editor screen.

2.  At the current cursor position (row 1, column 1), press **\<PF2\>B**
    > to add a block to the form at the cursor.

3.  When asked to select a new block name, enter your namespace
    > concatenated with "**MAIN 1**" (e.g.,Â "**Z*xxx* MAIN 1**"):

7.  Press **\<PF1\>E** to save the new block.

Any fields placed on this block are read-only, since this is a DISPLAY
block; in the next section, you will add several fields to the block.

TIP: Seeing Blocks, and Editing Block Properties:\
\
To see what blocks are on a page, press **\<PF1\>V** to switch to the
Block Viewer screen. The name of each block is displayed as a caption on
the page.\
\
To move the position of a block, do the following:

1.  *Select the block.*

3.  *Press **Spacebar** or **Enter**.*

4.  *Move it with the **arrow keys**,*

5.  *Deselect it by pressing **Spacebar** or **Enter** again.*

To edit the properties of the block, do the following:

1.  *Move the cursor to the block's caption.*

<!-- -->

10. *Select it by pressing **Spacebar** or **Enter**.*

11. *Press **PF4** to edit the properties of the block.\
    \
    When you are done working with blocks and want to exit the Block
    Viewer screen, press **\<PF1\>V** again to switch back to the main
    Form Editor screen.*

### Summary

To add an EDIT or DISPLAY block to a form:

1.  Press **\<PF2\>B**.

Select the block properties.

The position your cursor is at when you press **\<PF2\>B** defines the
regions of the block. You need to add at least one block to every page,
because fields *must* be placed on blocks (*not* directly on the page).

Add a Title (Caption-Only Field)
--------------------------------

### Overview

Once you have added a block to the form, you can start adding fields to
the block. First, you add a caption to the block, displaying the title
"NEW PERSON EDIT" at the top of the form.

### Procedure

To add a caption-only field to the block, do the following:

1.  Using the **arrow keys**, position the cursor at row 1, column 1.

At the current cursor position:

a.  Press **\<PF2\>F**. This brings up a dialogue similar to [Figure
    > 7]{.underline}:

1.  *Move the cursor to the field's caption.*

2.  *Press **Spacebar** or **Enter** to select the field.*

3.  *Press **PF4** to edit the properties.*

### Summary

Press **\<PF2\>F** to add fields to a block and fill in the properties.

To add a caption to a block, choose a field type of **CAPTION ONLY**.

Reposition Fields on a Block
----------------------------

### Overview

In Section [2.3]{.underline}, you added a caption field to the first
block. Now, use the Form Editor's visual editing capabilities to
reposition the caption field on the block.

To reposition the caption field on the block, do the following:

1.  Select the field.

2.  Move it.

3.  De-select the field.

### Procedure

To reposition fields on a block, do the following:

1.  In the Form Editor, use the **arrow keys** to position the cursor at
    > the first letter in the *caption* **N**EW PERSON EDIT.

Press **Spacebar** *or* **Enter** with the cursor in the field caption
to select the field; this highlights the entire field.

Move the field:

a.  With the field highlighted, move it by pressing the **arrow keys**.

<!-- -->

g.  Move the field to the center of row 1.\
    \
    The leftmost character of the field should be at row 1, column 32;
    you can tell by the R1,C32 indicator in the lower-right corner of
    the window: as shown in [Figure 11]{.underline}:

> []{#_Ref390246542 .anchor}Figure . Sample repositioning fields on a

Page: 1 (Page 1)

**\<PF1\>Q=Quit \<PF1\>E=Exit \<PF1\>S=Save \<PF1\>V=Block Viewer
\<PF1\>H=Help**

De-select the field. With the field highlighted (and in position), press
**Spacebar** *or* **Enter** to deselect (and drop) the field into place.

**TIP:** Moving Screen Elements:\
\
There are other shortcut keystrokes that you can use when moving screen
elements (e.g.,Â fields). These keystrokes (move field to top of screen,
move field to bottom of screen, etc.) are described in the "ScreenMan"
section in the VA FileMan User Manual.

### Summary

The Form Editor provides visual field positioning capabilities. This
lets you quickly position fields on blocks, which helps you build
visually attractive forms very quickly.

Add Data Dictionary Fields
--------------------------

### Overview

At this point, you have added one field, a caption-only field, to the
first block. Now, you will add the following data dictionary fields to
the DISPLAY-only block from the NEW PERSON file (\#200):

-   NAME

-   SSN

Because these fields are placed on a DISPLAY-only block, the values are
displayed to the form user, but are *not* editable.

### Procedure

#### Adding Name Field

To add the **NAME** field, do the following:

1.  Position the cursor at the beginning of the third line on the
    > screen, using the **arrow keys**:

<!-- -->

a.  Press **\<PF2\>F** to add a field to the block.

b.  Set the field up as shown in [Figure 12]{.underline}:

If you need to, you can re-position the fields in the same way that you
re-positioned the "NEW PERSON EDIT" caption in Section
[2.4.2]{.underline}.

#### Reposition Fields

To reposition fields, do the following:

1.  Select a field:

<!-- -->

a.  Move the cursor to the field **caption**.

b.  Press **Spacebar** *or* **Enter**.

Use the **arrow keys** to move the field.

Press **Enter** to drop the field in its new location.

**TIP: Positioning Data Dictionary Fields: Caption Portion and Data
Field Portion:**\
\
Data dictionary fields have two parts, caption and data field, which can
be positioned independently. If you position the cursor under the
caption of a data dictionary field and press **Spacebar** or **Enter**,
you select the caption and data field parts together. However, if you
position the cursor under the data field (the underlined portion) and
then select, you select the data field only, and can position it
independently of the field caption. In this tutorial, you should always
move the caption and data field together.

#### Deleting Fields

To delete a field, do the following:

1.  Select a field:

<!-- -->

a.  Move the cursor to the field **caption**.

<!-- -->

c.  Press **Spacebar** *or* **Enter**.

Press **PF4** to edit the properties of the element.

At the "Field Order:" prompt, enter an at-sign ("**@**").

At the "Are you sure you want to delete this entire Subrecord (Y/N)?"
prompt, enter **YES**.

![Caution](images/media/image3.png){width="0.4513888888888889in"
height="0.4513888888888889in"} CAUTION: Deletions are done
*immediately*! Exiting *without* saving will *not* restore deleted
records.

### Summary

Adding data dictionary fields is similar to adding caption-only fields;
you simply need to choose what field you want to add.

Use the Run a Form option to run and test your forms.

Add an Edit Block to the Form
-----------------------------

### Overview

In previous sections, you added fields to a DISPLAY-type block. Because
of the block they were added to, these fields are read-only. In this
section, you will add an EDIT-type block to the form; this lets you add
fields to the form that the user can actually edit.

### Procedure

To add the EDIT block, do the following:

1.  Invoke the Form Editor again, and load the Z*xxx* EDIT form.

In the Form Editor, use the **arrow keys** to position the cursor at row
5, column 1 on the form.

Press **\<PF2\>B** to add a block to the form at the cursor position
(row 5, column 1).

When asked to select a new block name, enter your namespace concatenated
with "**MAIN 2**" (e.g.,Â "**Z*xxx* MAIN 2**").

At the "Are you adding 'Z*xxx* MAIN 2' as a new block? No//" prompt,
enter **YES**.

At the "Are you adding Z*xxx* MAIN 2 as a new block on this page?"
prompt, enter **YES**. You are now given a chance to enter the
properties for the Z*xxx* MAIN 2 block.

In the "Block Properties Stored I n a FORM File" dialogue (see [Figure
19]{.underline}), verify the following data:

a.  **BLOCK ORDER** should be **2**.

b.  **TYPE OF BLOCK** should be **EDIT**.

c.  Accept the other defaults.

d.  Press **\<PF1\>E** to save the new block and exit.

*To delete a block:*

1.  *Edit the block's properties.*

2.  *Delete the block by entering an at-sign ("**@**") in the BLOCK NAME
    > field.*

### Summary

Adding an EDIT block to a form enables the editing of any data
dictionary fields placed on the EDIT-type block.

Add Data Dictionary Fields to the EDIT Block
--------------------------------------------

### Overview

In Section [2.7]{.underline}, you added an EDIT-type block to the form.
Now, you can add some data dictionary fields to the EDIT block. This
means that the user is actually able to edit data in the NEW PERSON file
(\#200) when they use the form.

In this section, you will add the following fields to the edit block
(Z*xxx* MAIN 2), in the order listed below:

1.  PHONE (HOME)

PHONE \#3

PHONE \#4

OFFICE PHONE

AUTO MENU

INITIAL

NICK NAME

PREFERRED EDITOR

TYPE-AHEAD

### Procedure

#### Add Fields

To add each field, do the following:

1.  Position the cursor somewhere on the Z*xxx* MAIN 2 block, which is
    > anywhere from row 5 to the bottom of the form; roughly where you
    > would like to place the field.

Press **\<PF2\>F** to add the individual field.

When the Form Editor asks for block, make sure you choose **Z*xxx* MAIN
2**:

a.  Accept the default FIELD ORDER.

b.  Make sure the **FIELD TYPE** is **DATA DICTIONARY FIELD**, as shown
    > in [Figure 20]{.underline}.

> []{#_Ref390245001 .anchor}Figure . Adding fields---Sample user

\| FIELD TYPE: **DATA DICTIONARY FIELD** \|

\| \|

\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\--

Press **\<PF1\>E** to save and exit this dialogue.

When you reach the "Data Dictionary Field Properties" dialogue:

a.  Choose the appropriate field by entering the field name in the FIELD
    > property. Enter one of the following fields (in the order listed):

-   PHONE (HOME)

-   PHONE \#3

-   PHONE \#4

-   OFFICE PHONE

-   AUTO MENU

-   INITIAL

-   NICK NAME

-   PREFERRED EDITOR

-   TYPE-AHEAD

b.  Press **\<PF1\>E** to save the new field.

c.  Repeat Steps 1 through 5b for each of the fields listed in Step 5a.

After you have added each of the fields to the block, arrange the fields
so that their captions are all right-aligned (i.e.,Â colons terminating
each caption should be in a vertical line). Use the Form Editor's visual
capabilities to do this:

a.  As you did before with the NEW PERSON EDIT caption, select each
    > field:

<!-- -->

i.  Place the cursor over the first letter of the field caption.

ii. Press **Spacebar** or **Enter**. This selects (highlights) the
    field.

<!-- -->

b.  Use the **arrow keys** to move the field.

c.  Press **Spacebar** *or* **Enter** again to drop the field into place
    > and deselect the field.

By default, the "edit order" of the fields on the form is the same order
in which you add fields to the form. You can change the field order on
the block at a later time, however.

Press **\<PF1\>E** to exit the Form Editor.

Choose the Run a Form option to run and test the form. The form should
now look like [Figure 21]{.underline} (with sample data):

> []{#_Ref390245203 .anchor}Figure . Sample form with added fields

COMMAND: Press \<PF1\>H for help Insert

a.  Test the field order. Starting at the initial field that ScreenMan
    > places you in, press **Enter** at each field; you should move to
    > the next field down on the form, until you traverse all fields and
    > are placed at the COMMAND prompt.

b.  If the field order is *not* correct, however, you can return to the
    > Form Editor and change the field order for any field.

#### Change Field Order

To change the field order for any field, do the following:

1.  Select the field whose order you want to change:

<!-- -->

a.  Move the cursor to the field **caption**.

b.  Press **Spacebar** *or* **Enter** to select the field.

Press **PF4** to edit the field properties.

Change the field order to a different number (decimal fractions are
allowed).

#### Reset Field Order

Alternatively, you can reset the field order of *all* fields to be
left-to-right, top-to-bottom.

To reset the field order of all fields to left-to-right, top-to-bottom,
do the following:

1.  From the Form Editor, go to the Block Viewer screen by pressing
    > **\<PF1\>V**.

Select the block in question:

a.  Move cursor to it.

b.  Press **Spacebar** *or* **Enter** to select the block.

Press **\<PF1\>O** to reorder the field sequence.

Press **Spacebar** *or* **Enter** again to de-select the block.

Press **\<PF1\>V** to return to the normal Form Editor screen.

**TIP: Display Width vs. Actual Width for Fields:\
**\
Some fields are longer than a form is wide; fields can be up to 245
characters in length. How can you edit a field like this in a ScreenMan
form, which is only 80 characters wide? The answer is that when you
place a field like this on a form, you can set the field's display width
by setting its DATA LENGTH property. You could set its DATA LENGTH to be
75, for example. Then, when the user runs the form, the field is
displayed in a 75-character-wide window. To see and edit the entire
field, the user can press **\<PF1\>Z**; this opens a large edit area at
the bottom of the screen.\
\
You can use this technique even with fields that fit within the width of
your form. For example, you might have a field that is 60 characters in
length, but set it so that it only takes up 30 characters when displayed
on your form (by setting its DATA LENGTH to 30).

![Caution](images/media/image3.png){width="0.4583333333333333in"
height="0.4583333333333333in"} CONGRATULATIONS: Making an interface to
edit fields in the NEW PERSON file (\#200) was as easy as that!

### Summary

To let users edit data in a VA FileMan file, you can add data dictionary
fields to an Edit-type block on the form. The field order (when the user
traverses fields by pressing **Enter**) is, by default, the order you
add fields to the form. You can change the field order at a later time,
if necessary.

Use PRINT\^DDS to List Form Characteristics
-------------------------------------------

### Overview

At this point, you have added several blocks and a number of fields to
the form.

When you are working with forms, you can generate a report on your form
so that you can review your form's characteristics. ScreenMan provides a
way to do this using the following direct-mode utility:

**D PRINT\^DDS**

This lists all characteristics of a form. It lists the properties of the
form itself and all properties of the blocks and fields used on the
form.

### Procedure

To generate a report on your form so that you can review your form's
characteristics, do the following:

1.  From the M programmer prompt, run **PRINT\^DDS**.

Compare the output for your form to the output listed below. The
printout for your form thus far should correspond to the printout listed
in [Figure 22]{.underline}:

![Caution](images/media/image3.png){width="0.4583333333333333in"
height="0.4583333333333333in"} CONGRATULATIONS: This is the end of the
first section of the hands-on tutorial! You have:

-   Created a ScreenMan form.

-   Linked it to a file.

-   Added both display-only and editable fields to the form.

If you want to try out some of the more advanced features of ScreenMan,
continue on to the next section of this tutorial!

Pages, Multiples, and Computed Fields
=====================================

![Note](images/media/image2.png){width="0.3125in" height="0.3125in"}
**NOTE:** This section continues to build on the form you designed in
Section [2]{.underline}.

This section demonstrates some of the more typical things a developer
might want to do with a form, beyond the adding of simple fields to a
single page. It shows how to add pages to a form, and shows two ways of
editing Multiple fields on a form. Also, it shows how to enhance the
presentation of information with ScreenMan computed fields. You will do
the following:

-   Add a second page to your form.

-   Edit a Multiple field using a repeating block.

-   Edit a Multiple field using a popup page.

-   Resize and reposition the popup page.

-   Add a ScreenMan computed field, enhancing the presentation of the
    Multiple in the repeating block.

Add a Page to a Form
--------------------

### Overview

Forms can have more than one page. They can have many pages, each page
with its own blocks. Some reasons to use more than one page in a form
are:

-   There are too many fields to fit on one page.

-   You want to edit fields in a different file or in a Multiple.

-   You want to display information in a "popup" page.

### Procedures

#### Add a Page to a Form

To add a page to a form, do the following:

1.  Invoke the Form Editor, using either the menu option (see [Figure
    > 2]{.underline}) or the direct-mode utility (see Section
    > [2.1.1.2.2]{.underline}).

The first thing you are asked is for what file to create a form. Since
we are creating a form to edit the NEW PERSON file (\#200), enter **NEW
PERSON**.

You are now asked for a form name. Entering two question marks lists
current forms defined for the NEW PERSON file (\#200). For this section,
continue editing the form you created in Section [2]{.underline}.

![Note](images/media/image2.png){width="0.3125in" height="0.3125in"}
**NOTE:** From hereon in, the namespace part of a name is referred to as
"Z*xxx*" in the tutorial.

Once you select a name for the form, you are placed in the ScreenMan's
Form Editor.

Press **\<PF2\>P** to add a page.

Choose a unique page number for the page.

In the new page's properties, fill in a page number for both the **NEXT
PAGE** and **PREVIOUS PAGE** properties. This tells ScreenMan what pages
to go to when the user moves backwards or forwards from the page.

Adjust the **PREVIOUS PAGE** and **NEXT PAGE** properties of other pages
to make sure that the total sequence of pages is adjusted to include the
new page.

Add a block to the new page. Every page should have at least one block.

#### Add a Second Page to a Form

To add a second page to a form, do the following:

1.  In the Form Editor, load the Z*xxx* EDIT USER form.

2.  Press **\<PF2\>P** to add a page.

3.  In a popup window, you are asked for the **NEW PAGE NUMBER**. In
    > general, you should number the pages in your form sequentially, so
    > it is easy to keep track of them. Since this is the second page in
    > the form, enter **2**.

4.  At the "Are you adding Page 2 as a new page on this form?" prompt,
    > enter **YES**.

5.  The Form Editor presents a "Page Properties" dialogue letting you
    > edit the characteristics of the new page.

<!-- -->

a.  Enter **1** for the **NEXT PAGE** and **PREVIOUS PAGE** properties.

b.  Accept the defaults for all other properties.

The page properties should match those in [Figure 24]{.underline}:

![Note](images/media/image2.png){width="0.3125in" height="0.3125in"}
**NOTE:** Next, you will need to add a block to the page.

#### Add an Edit Block

The new page needs at least one block.

To add an edit-type block to the page, do the following**:**

1.  In the Form Editor, on Page 2, position the cursor at row 1, column
    > 1 (top-left corner).

Press **\<PF2\>B** to add a block to the form at the cursor position
(row 1, column 1).

When asked to select a new block name, enter your namespace concatenated
with " **MAIN 3**" (e.g.,Â "**Z*xxx* MAIN 3**").

At the "Are you adding 'Z*xxx* MAIN 3' as a new BLOCK? No//" prompt,
enter **YES**.

At the "Are you adding 'Z*xxx* MAIN 3' as a new block on this page?"
prompt, enter **YES**.

You are now given a chance to enter the properties for the Z*xxx* MAIN 3
block.

Verify the following entries:

-   **BLOCK ORDER** should be **1**.

-   **TYPE OF BLOCK** should be **EDIT**.

-   Accept the other defaults.

The block properties should match those shown in [Figure

another, see the "ScreenMan" section in the VA FileMan User Manual.

#### Link Pages

Link the first page to the second by moving back to the first page and
setting the first page's **NEXT PAGE** property to **2**.

To link the first page to the second, do the following:

1.  Press **\<PF1\>P** to change pages, and enter **1** as the "change
    > to" page.

Once Page 1 is the current page, enter **\<PF4\>P** to edit the Page 1
properties.

For the **NEXT PAGE** and **PREVIOUS PAGE** properties, enter **2** (see
[Figure 26]{.underline}).

Press **\<PF1\>E** to save the properties for Page 1.

Once you are back in the Form Editor, press **\<PF1\>E** to save the
form and exit.

Run and test the form using the Run a Form option:

a.  You should have a new choice, **Next Page**, from Page 1 at the
    > COMMAND prompt.

<!-- -->

j.  Choosing **Next Page** at the COMMAND prompt should move you to the
    (currently blank) second page of the form.

k.  Pressing **\<PF1\>\<ARROWDOWN\>** should move you to the next page.

l.  Pressing **\<PF1\>\<ARROWUP\>** should move you to the previous
    page.

As a final touch, you can add two CAPTION fields at the top-right
corners of the two pages:

-   "Page 1 of 2" on the first page.

-   "Page 2 of 2" on the second page.

Summary
-------

Forms can have multiple pages. When you add pages, your main task is to
make sure that your pages all have appropriate **PREVIOUS PAGE** and
**NEXT PAGE** links, so that a correct sequence of pages is available to
users of your form.

Add a Multiple Field (in a Repeating Block)
-------------------------------------------

### Overview

You can provide users with the ability to edit data that is in a
Multiple. The two common ways to edit Multiples on forms are:

-   Add a repeating block that is dedicated to the Multiple.

-   Add a popup page that is dedicated to the Multiple.

In this section, you will let the user edit data in a Multiple using a
repeating block. You will add the ability on the form to edit the
SECONDARY MENU OPTIONS Multiple in the NEW PERSON file (\#200).

A repeating block presents multiple entries in a scrolling list, making
it possible to display more than one entry from the Multiple to the user
at the same time. The main limitation to using a repeating block is that
*all* fields to be edited *must* fit on one line on the screen.

The general process to set up a Multiple in a repeating block is:

1.  Add a new block (of type EDIT) to a page.

In the new block's **OTHER PARAMETERS** section, set the **REPLICATION**
property to the length of the list to in which to display Multiple
entries.

Set the **DD NUMBER** property of the new block to the DD number of the
Multiple.

Add the fields to edit in the Multiple (all in one line) to the
repeating block (remove all captions).

If you want to add column "heading" captions above the row of fields,
you can do so, but add the captions to a different block (*not* the
repeating block). The only fields that should be on the repeating block
should be one line of data fields.

In this section, you will add a repeating block to Page 2 of the form to
edit the SECONDARY MENU OPTIONS Multiple in the NEW PERSON file (\#200).

### Procedures

#### Add Repeating Block

To add a repeating block, do the following:

1.  Position the cursor on the Page 2 of the form, at row 5, column 7.

Press **\<PF2\>B** to add a new block to the current page.

For block name, enter **Z*xxx* REPEATING 1**.

At the "Are you adding 'Z*xxx* REPEATING 1' as a new BLOCK? No//"
prompt, enter **YES**.

At the "Are you adding Z*xxx* REPEATING 1 as a new block on this page?"
prompt, enter **YES**.

Enter the following data:

a.  **BLOCK ORDER** should be **2**.

b.  **TYPE OF BLOCK** should be **EDIT**.

At the "OTHER PARAMETERS..." prompt, press **Enter**.

In the "Other Block Parameter" dialogue, do the following:

a.  Set **REPLICATION** to be **4**. This makes the block a repeating
    > block and sets the number of entries to display on screen to 4.

### Summary

You can use a repeating block to edit Multiples:

-   Advantage---You can present a list of entries from a Multiple on
    your form.

-   Disadvantage---All the fields from the Multiple that you want to
    display or edit *must* fit on a single line.

Add a Multiple Field (in a Popup Page)
--------------------------------------

#### Overview

In Section [3.3]{.underline}, you used a repeating block to let the user
edit *one* line's worth of fields from a Multiple. If you want the user
to be able to edit *many* fields from a given a Multiple, you can create
a popup page and set up the Multiple to be edited there.

The general process to set up a Multiple to be edited in a popup page
is:

1.  Add the parent field of the Multiple in question (at the DD level of
    > the form's primary file) to your form.

Add a popup page, dedicated to the DD number of the Multiple.

Link the popup page back to the Multiple's parent field through the
page's **PARENT FIELD** property.

Add a block to the popup page.

Add the desired fields from the Multiple to the popup page's block.

### Procedures

In this section, you will edit the DIVISION Multiple in a popup page:

1.  **[Add the DIVISION Multiple Field]{.underline}---**Add the DIVISION
    > field to the appropriate block on an existing page.

2.  **[Add a Popup Page for the DIVISION Multiple]{.underline}---**Link
    > that field to a popup page you will build, where you will place
    > that Multiple's fields.

#### Add the DIVISION Multiple Field

To add the DIVISION Multiple field to the **Z*xxx* MAIN 3** block, do
the following:

1.  In the Form Editor, go to Page 2 of your form:

<!-- -->

a.  Press **\<PF1\>P**.

b.  Enter **2**.

Position the cursor at row 10, column 7, and press **\<PF2\>F** to add a
field.

Add the field to the block **Z*xxx* MAIN 3**:

a.  Accept the default field order.

b.  Make sure the field type is **DATA DICTIONARY FIELD**.

c.  Press **\<PF1\>E** to save the changes.

In the "Data Dictionary Field Properties" dialogue, do the following:

a.  Set **FIELD** to **DIVISION**.

b.  Press **\<PF1\>E** to save the field properties.

You should now see a field for DIVISION on the Form Editor screen.

#### Add a Popup Page for the DIVISION Multiple

To add a popup page for the DIVISION Multiple, do the following:

1.  Press **\<PF2\>P** to add a new page.

2.  One scheme for numbering popup pages is to number them as some
    > fraction added to the page number from which they pop up.

Set the **PAGE NUMBER** field to **2.5**, since this popup page "pops
up" from Page 2.

Set the **PAGE COORDINATE** field to **5,5**.

In the "Page Properties" dialogue, set the **IS THIS A POP UP PAGE?**
field to **YES**.

Set the **LOWER RIGHT COORDINATE** field to **15,75**.

Fill in **PARENT FIELD**. The format for PARENT FIELD is:

field id,block name,page name

Set **PARENT FIELD** to "**DIVISION,Z*xxx* MAIN 3,2**". This links the
popup page to the DIVISION field on block Z*xxx* MAIN 3, on Page 2.

### Summary

To edit a Multiple when the needed fields do *not* fit on one screen
line, use a popup page instead:

1.  Place the top-level of the Multiple as a single field on a block.

Create a popup page for the Multiple fields.

Link the popup page back to the single field using the page's **PARENT
FIELD** property.

Reposition and Resize the Popup Page

Press **Spacebar** *or* **Enter** again to de-select the popup page, at
which time it is repositioned to fit where you moved the page corners.

#### Resize the Popup Page

To resize the popup page, do the following:

1.  With the popup page still displayed, press the **\<TAB\>** key until
    > the cursor is positioned at the lower-right corner of the popup
    > page. Selecting a popup page when the cursor is at the lower-right
    > corner lets you resize the page.

Press **Spacebar** *or* **Enter** to select the popup page.

The four corners of the page should be highlighted.

Experiment with moving the cursor up, down, left, and right. The corners
will position accordingly, representing the new size of the window.

Press **Spacebar** *or* **Enter** to de-select the popup page, at which
time it is resized to fit where you moved the page corners.

Add a ScreenMan Computed Field
------------------------------

### Overview

A ScreenMan computed field exists only on a form; it is *not* a data
dictionary field. A computed field can be useful to display information
that is computed "on-the-fly".

The value of a ScreenMan computed field is determined by an M expression
that sets the variable Y. In the M code (in the field's COMPUTED
EXPRESSION property), you can:

-   Refer to values of other fields on the current block, by using the
    other field name in braces. For example:

{SECONDARY MENU OPTIONS}.

-   Use navigational syntax when referring to fields as well. For
    example:

{SECONDARY MENU OPTIONS:MENU TEXT}.

### Procedure

In this section, you will add a computed field to the form to provide a
user-friendly description for the list of secondary menu options you
added in a previous lesson. The computed field uses navigational syntax
to retrieve and display the MENU TEXT field value (from the OPTION file
\[\#19\]) based on the value of the SECONDARY MENU OPTIONS field.

To add the computed field, do the following:

1.  Return to Page 2 of the form:

<!-- -->

a.  Press **\<PF1\>P**.

b.  Choose Page **2**.

On Page 2 of the form, position the cursor at row 5, column 50.

Press **\<PF2\>F** to add a field at the cursor position.

Place the new field on block Z*xxx* REPEATING 1:

-   **FIELD ORDER** should be **3.**

-   **FIELD TYPE** should be **COMPUTED**.

Press **\<PF1\>E** to save the changes.

In the "Computed Field Properties" dialogue, set the COMPUTED EXPRESSION
to be:

**S Y={SECONDARY MENU OPTIONS:MENU TEXT}**

This expression uses the SECONDARY MENU OPTIONS field, which is on the
same block as the computed field. It also uses navigational syntax to
retrieve the value of the MENU TEXT field, which is in the OPTION file
(\#19) and is linked via the SECONDARY MENU OPTIONS pointer field.

Resize the field. To set the size of the new field, do the following:

a.  With the cursor positioned at the new field (its length is only 1),
    > press **PF3**.

b.  The field should now be highlighted. Also, the R,C row/column
    > indicator in the lower-right corner of the screen changes to L=1
    > (now indicating length of the field is 1).

c.  With the field highlighted, use the **right-arrow** key to expand
    > the size of the field until its length is **25** (L=25 in
    > indicator).

d.  Press **PF3** again to "un-highlight" the field.

### Summary

Computed fields provide a way to display "on-the-fly" computed
information to the user. Computed fields can be totally standalone, or
can be based on the values of other fields on the same block.

![Caution](images/media/image3.png){width="0.4583333333333333in"
height="0.4583333333333333in"} CONGRATULATIONS: This is the end of the
second section of the hands-on tutorial! You have explored some of the
advanced capabilities of ScreenMan forms, including:

-   Adding pages to a form.

-   Editing Multiples.

-   Working with computed fields.

If you want to try out some more of the advanced features of ScreenMan,
continue on to the next (and last) section of this tutorial!

Advanced Features for Forms
===========================

![Note](images/media/image2.png){width="0.3125in" height="0.3125in"}
**NOTE:** This section continues to build on the form you designed in
Section [3]{.underline}.

This section demonstrates some of finishing touches you can use to
fine-tune your forms. It shows how to edit fields in another file, how
to use branching logic, and how to use form-only fields to read user
input. It also shows how to make a Kernel option out of your form. You
will do the following:

-   Edit fields in another file, using pointer navigation to reach the
    other file.

-   Add branching logic for fields.

-   Use ScreenMan Form-only fields for user input.

-   Create a Kernel option to make the form accessible to users.

Edit Fields in Other Files
--------------------------

### Overview

When you create a form, you tie the form to a particular file. For
example, the form you have been building is tied to the NEW PERSON file
(\#200).

You can edit fields in another file on your form, however. The easiest
way is if there is a pointer field from the form's primary file to the
file you want to edit fields in. In this case:

1.  Your form's primary file already has a forward pointer field to the
    > other file.

2.  You need to add a new block (a block can only hold fields from one
    > DD level).

3.  Tie the new block, through its **POINTER LINK** property, to the
    > field that is the forward pointer in the primary file. The pointer
    > link is the expression that describes the relational jump.

4.  Tie the new block, through its **DD NUMBER** property, to the data
    > dictionary number of the other file.

5.  To edit fields in the other file, add them to the block that is tied
    > to the DD number of the other file.

There are other types of relational navigation that can establish the
link between files also:

-   Backward pointers

-   Lookups

![Note](images/media/image2.png){width="0.3125in" height="0.3125in"}
**REF:** For more information on using other types of relational
navigation in ScreenMan forms, see the "Relational Navigation" section
in the *VA FileMan Advanced User Manual*.

### Procedures

In this section you will:

1.  Add the SERVICE/SECTION pointer field to the form; it points from
    > the NEW PERSON file (\#200) to the SERVICE/SECTION file (\#49).

Use that forward pointer field to navigate to the SERVICE/SECTION file
(\#49). This lets the form users edit the entry in the SERVICE/SECTION
file (\#49) being pointed to by the entry they are editing in the NEW
PERSON file (\#200).

#### Add the SERVICE/SECTION Field

To add the SERVICE/SECTION field to Page 2 of the form, do the
following:

1.  Invoke the Form Editor, using either the menu option (see [Figure
    > 2]{.underline}) or the direct-mode utility (see Section
    > [2.1.1.2.2]{.underline}).

The first thing you are asked is for what file to create a form. Since
we are creating a form to edit the NEW PERSON file (\#200), enter **NEW
PERSON**.

You are now asked for a form name. Entering two question marks lists
current forms defined for the NEW PERSON file (\#200). For this section,
continue editing the form you created in Section [3]{.underline}.

![Note](images/media/image2.png){width="0.3125in" height="0.3125in"}
**NOTE:** From hereon in, the namespace part of a name is referred to as
"Z*xxx*" in the tutorial.

Once you select a name for the form, you are placed in the ScreenMan's
Form Editor.

On Page 2 of the form:

a.  Position the cursor at row 14, column 18.

b.  Press **\<PF2\>F** to add a new field at the cursor position.

When the Form Editor asks for block, make sure you choose **Z*xxx* MAIN
3**:

a.  Accept the default **FIELD ORDER**.

b.  Make sure the **FIELD TYPE** is **DATA DICTIONARY FIELD**.

Press **\<PF1\>E** to save and exit this dialogue.

When you reach the "Data Dictionary Field Properties" dialogue, set
**FIELD** to **SERVICE/SECTION**.

Press **\<PF1\>E** to save the new field.

#### Add a Block to Edit Fields

You can add a block to the form to edit fields in the SERVICE/SECTION
file (\#49). This allows users to edit several fields in the
SERVICE/SECTION file (\#49) for whichever entry they have selected as
their current SERVICE/SECTION.

To add a block to edit fields in the SERVICE/SECTION file (\#49), do the
following:

1.  On Page 2 of the form:

<!-- -->

a.  Position the cursor at row 12, column 7.

b.  Press **\<PF2\>B** to add a new block at the cursor position.

<!-- -->

2.  Enter **Z*xxx* POINTER 1** as the new block name.

3.  At the "Are you adding \'Z*xxx* POINTER 1\' as a new BLOCK? No//"
    > prompt, enter **YES**.

4.  At the "Are you adding Z*xxx* POINTER 1 as a new block on this
    > page?" prompt, enter **YES**.

5.  In the "Block Properties Stored in FORM File" dialogue, the **TYPE
    > OF BLOCK** should be **EDIT**.

6.  In the **POINTER LINK** field, enter **SERVICE/SECTION**. This is
    > the navigational syntax needed to read fields in the
    > SERVICE/SECTION file (\#49) from the NEW PERSON file (\#200).

7.  In the **DD NUMBER** field, enter **49**. This is the DD number of
    > the SERVICE/SECTION file (\#49). This means that only
    > SERVICE/SECTION file (\#49) fields can be added as data dictionary
    > fields to this block.

8.  The block properties should look like [Figure 45]{.underline}:

9.  Press **\<PF1\>E** to save the new block.

#### Add Data Dictionary Fields

Once you have created the new block, do the following:

1.  Add fields to the block (**Z*xxx* POINTER 1**) in the usual manner.

2.  Position them below the SERVICE/SECTION field.

3.  Add the following three Data Dictionary fields from the
    > SERVICE/SECTION file (\#49) to the new block (**Z*xxx* POINTER
    > 1**):

-   MAIL SYMBOL (use a caption of "SERVICE MAIL SYMBOL").

-   CHIEF (use a caption of "SERVICE CHIEF").

-   ASST CHIEF (use a caption of "SERVICE ASST CHIEF").

![Note](images/media/image2.png){width="0.3125in" height="0.3125in"}
**NOTE:** To prevent the user from deleting or changing the name of the
SERVICE/SECTION entry being edited, you are *not* letting users edit the
.01 field.

Add caption fields above the four SERVICE/SECTION fields, with the
heading "Service Information".

Run and test the form. You should now be able to edit fields in the
SERVICE/SECTION; this is accomplished by navigating from the NEW PERSON
file (\#200) via the SERVICE/SECTION field!

### Summary

You can use ScreenMan to edit the fields in any associated entry from
another file. Fields from another file *must* be placed on their own
block, and the navigational link to the block is described through the
block's **POINTER LINK** property.

Add Branching Logic for Fields
------------------------------

### Overview

You can automatically branch the user from one field on the form to
another by setting the DDSBR variable in the **BRANCHING LOGIC** field
property. The BRANCHING LOGIC is executed when the user presses
**Enter** at the field.

The following variables are defined for any code executed from a field's
**BRANCHING LOGIC** property (and other properties that accept M code):

[]{#_Toc395709633 .anchor}Table . BRANCHING LOGIC property Variables

  Variable   Value
  ---------- ---------------------------------------
  X          Current internal value of the field.
  DDSEXT     Current external value of the field.
  DDSOLD     Previous internal value of the field.

To jump to another field on the form, you can set the DDSBR variable in
the original field's BRANCHING LOGIC field. You should set the DDSBR
variable in the following format:

Field ID\^Block ID\^Page ID

Where:

[]{#_Toc395709634 .anchor}Table . DDSBR Variable Format Pieces

  Piece      Value
  ---------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Field ID   Caption of field, Unique Name of field, or Field Order number of field to jump to.
  Block ID   Block Order number or Block Name to jump to.
  Page ID    Page Number or Page Name to jump to.

### Procedure

In this example, you will add branching logic to the OFFICE PHONE field,
which is on page 1 of the form. You set up the branching logic so that
if there is a defined value for OFFICE PHONE, the user goes directly to
the SERVICE/SECTION fields on Page 2 of the form. If there is *not* a
defined value, the user stays on Page 1.

#### Add Branching Logic

To add branching logic to the OFFICE PHONE field, do the following:

1.  Go to Page 1 of the form:

<!-- -->

a.  Press **\<PF1\>P**.

b.  Choose Page **1**.

<!-- -->

2.  Move the cursor to the OFFICE PHONE field caption, and select it.

3.  With the OFFICE PHONE selected, press **PF4** to edit its field
    > properties. In the **BRANCHING LOGIC** field property, enter:

S:\$L(X) DDSBR="SERVICE/SECTION\^Z*xxx* MAIN 3\^PAGE 2"

This code conditionally branches to the field with the "SERVICE/SECTION"
caption, on block **Z*xxx* MAIN 3**, on Page 2 of the form, provided
that there is a defined value for the OFFICE PHONE field.

5.  Press **\<PF1\>E** to save the form and exit.

6.  Run and test the form:

<!-- -->

a.  Enter a value for OFFICE PHONE. You should branch immediately to the
    > SERVICE/SECTION fields on Page 2 of the form.

b.  Go back and delete the value for OFFICE PHONE. In this case, the
    > branching logic should leave you where you are, on Page 1 of the
    > form.

**TIP: Other Properties Where You Can Set DDSBR:**\
\
You can also set the DDSBR variable at the field level properties PRE
ACTION, POST ACTION, and POST ACTION ON CHANGE, as well as at the form
level property DATA VALIDATION. You can set the DDSSTACK variable only
at the field level **BRANCHING LOGIC** property, however.

**TIP: Using DDSSTACK to "Stack" Another Form Location:**\
\
Rather than simply "going" to another location on the form using the
DDSBR variable, you can "stack" another location of the form using the
DDSSTACK variable. The difference with the DDSSTACK variable is that
when a user jumps to another location, does their work, and closes the
jumped to page, they are returned to the original page. DDSBR, on the
other hand, acts similarly to the M **GOTO** command; the user is not
returned to their original location after a jump.

### Summary

You can use branching logic to conditionally branch from one location on
a form to another location on the form; even if the locations are on
different pages.

Use Form-Only Fields for User Input
-----------------------------------

### Overview

ScreenMan provides Form-Only fields as a way to read user input without
tying that input to a dictionary field. They act similarly to the VA
FileMan \^DIR reader call, allowing you to read data as a VA FileMan
data type (e.g.,Â Free Text, Yes/No, Numeric, etc.)

To use form only fields, do the following:

1.  Create a field and set the field type to **FORM ONLY**.

2.  In the field's properties, under FORM ONLY FIELD PARAMETERS, set the
    > field's **READ TYPE** property to reflect the type of read you
    > want to do.

3.  To retrieve the value of the field in M code, you can refer to the
    > regular variables for a field:

-   X (current internal value)

-   DDSEXT (current external value)

-   DDSOLD (previous internal value)

### Procedure

Add a form-only field to Page 1 of the form, asking the user whether
they want to jump to page 2 of the form or *not*. If they answer
**YES**, you use the DDSBR variable to branch them to Page 2 of the
form.

To add a form-only field, do the following:

1.  Go to Page 1 of the form:

<!-- -->

a.  Press **\<PF1\>P**.

b.  Choose Page **1**.

Move the cursor to row 16, column 8:

a.  Press **\<PF2\>F** to add a field.

b.  Add the field to the **Z*xxx* MAIN 2** block.

c.  Choose **FORM ONLY** as the **FIELD TYPE**.

In the "Form Only Field Properties" dialogue:

a.  Press **Enter** at the **FORM ONLY FIELD PARAMETERS...** field.

b.  In the "Other Form Only Field Properties" dialogue, set the **READ
    > TYPE** field to "**YES OR NO**". This makes the field read a
    > **YES** or **NO** response from the user.

c.  Press **\<PF1\>E** to save the new field parameters.

Back on the "Form Only Field Properties" dialogue, set the **CAPTION**
property to "**Go to Page 2**".

Add branching logic in the **BRANCHING LOGIC** property as follows:

**S:+X DDSBR="\^\^Page 2"**

This branches to Page 2, if X (the value of the form-only field in
internal format) is positive (if the user answered **YES** at the
field).

Press **\<PF1\>E** to save the new field properties.

Exit the Form Editor.

Run and test the form:

a.  If you answer **YES** in the new form-only field, you should jump to
    > Page 2 of the form.

b.  If you answer **NO**, you should stay on the current page.

### Summary

You can use form-only fields to read a variety of input from the user,
*without* that input having to be tied to a data dictionary field.

Turn Your ScreenMan Form into an Option
---------------------------------------

### Overview

Until now, you have been running your form using ScreenMan's Run a Form
option. However, end-users would need your form set up as an option.
This section shows you how to turn the form into an option in the menu
system.

The two most typical ways to set up an option for a ScreenMan form are:

-   Create a Run Routine-type option, and a routine to run.

-   Create a ScreenMan-type option.

In either case (Run Routine or ScreenMan-type option), your option needs
to:

1.  Determine the record number of the NEW PERSON file (\#200) entry to
    > edit.

2.  Call ScreenMan and load the form once the record number is known
    > (\^DDS entry point).

### Procedures

#### Create a Run-Routine-Type Option

To create a Run Routine-type option, do the following:

1.  Create a routine that determines the record number to edit (use the
    > \^DIC entry point).

2.  Invoke ScreenMan (\^DDS entry point) to edit the record.

![Note](images/media/image2.png){width="0.3125in" height="0.3125in"}
**REF:** For more information on these entry points, see the *VA FileMan
Developer's Guide*.

[Table 5]{.underline} lists the input variables you need for the \^DDS
entry point:

> []{#_Ref390252840 .anchor}Table . \^DDS Entry Point---Input Variables

  Input Variable   Description
  ---------------- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **DDSFILE**      The number or global root of the primary file of the form.
  **DR**           The name of the form, enclosed in square brackets (**\[ \]**).
  **DA**           The record number of the file entry to display or edit.
  **DDSPAGE**      (Optional) The page number of the first page to display to the user. If DDSPAGE is *not* defined, there *must* be a page number = 1 in the form.
  **DDSPARM**      (Optional) Flags controlling return values from ScreenMan.

Clone the routine in [Figure 50]{.underline} in your namespace. This
routine does the following:

-   Determines the record number of the NEW PERSON file (\#200) entry to
    edit.

-   Calls \^DDS.

> []{#_Ref390252918 .anchor}Figure . Sample routine that determines the

.S DA=+Y,DDSFILE=200,DR="\[ZYXW EDIT\]",DDSPAGE=1

.D \^DDS

Create a "Run Routine"-type option that calls EN\^Z*xxx*ED1 as the
routine to run.

Run the option.

You should now have a Menu Manager option that runs your form!

#### Create a ScreenMan-Type Option

You can quickly set up a ScreenMan-type option to run your form. This
option does exactly what the run routine-type option shown above does:

1.  Uses \^DIC to determine a record to edit \[controlled by the **DIC
    > {DIC}** and **DIC(0)** fields\].

Uses \^DDS to load your ScreenMan form \[controlled by the **DR{DDS}**,
**DDSFILE**, and **DDSPAGE** fields\].

To create a ScreenMan-type option, do the following:

1.  Set up the option as shown in [Figure 51]{.underline} (substitute
    > your namespace for Z*xxx*). Setting up the option this way is
    > quicker than writing a routine!

[]{#_Ref390253520 .anchor}Figure . Sample ScreenMan-type option setup

NAME: Z*xxx* NEW PERSON EDIT MENU TEXT: Z*xxx* NEW PERSON EDIT

TYPE: ScreenMan

DIC {DIC}: VA(200, DIC(0): AEMQ

DR{DDS}: \[Z*xxx* EDIT\] DDSFILE: 200

DDSPAGE: 1

UPPERCASE MENU TEXT: Z*xxx* NEW PERSON EDIT

2.  Run and test the option.

**TIP: Record Selection within ScreenMan:**\
\
The options in this lesson determine what record to edit before invoking
ScreenMan. To edit a subsequent record, the user must exit ScreenMan,
choose another record, and then enter ScreenMan again. You can, however,
set up a Record Selection Page to allow record selection to happen
within ScreenMan. To do this:

1.  *Add a popup page to your form.*

2.  *Add an edit block to the page.*

<!-- -->

12. *Add one field to this page: a pointer-type form-only field.*

13. *In the **Qualifiers** property of the form-only field, specify the
    number of the file that is your ScreenMan form's primary file.*

14. *Set the field's caption to something like "Choose a record to
    edit", and set its data length property to an appropriate size for
    entering the name of a record in your file.*

15. *Set the **form-level** property **Record Selection Page** to the
    page number of this page.*

Once you have done this, you can invoke \^DDS without specifying the DA
of the record to edit; with no DA, ScreenMan uses the record selection
page to prompt the user to choose a record. Once they are editing a
record, the user can press **\<PF1\>L** to choose another record to
edit, without leaving ScreenMan.

### Summary

To run your form from an option, you can make either a run routine or
ScreenMan-type option. In either case, the option *must*:

1.  Determines the record number to edit from your form's primary file.

Calls \^DDS to invoke ScreenMan.

Where to Go From Here
---------------------

![Caution](images/media/image3.png){width="0.4583333333333333in"
height="0.4583333333333333in"} CONGRATULATIONS: This is the end of the
hands-on tutorial!

At this point, you have done the following:

-   Built a ScreenMan form from scratch.

-   Enhanced the form with a number of advanced ScreenMan features.

-   Made a Kernel option out of the form.

You can try creating ScreenMan forms for your own projects now. Feel
free to turn back to this tutorial as you do so.

![Note](images/media/image2.png){width="0.3125in" height="0.3125in"}
**REF:** For a full reference for the ScreenMan Form Editor and other
ScreenMan features, see the "ScreenMan" section in the *VA FileMan User
Manual.*\
\
For a full reference on the ScreenMan API, see the *VA FileMan
Developer's Guide*.

Challenge yourself; the sky is the limit!

[Figure 52]{.underline} is just one example of the kind of visually
appealing, usable forms that you can create with ScreenMan:

**NOTE:** Some additional features of ScreenMan and the Form Editor are
*not* covered by this tutorial. For example, there are additional
properties for fields, blocks, pages, and forms that are *not* described
in this tutorial.

![Note](images/media/image2.png){width="0.3125in" height="0.3125in"}
**REF:** For more information on these additional properties and other
ScreenMan and Form Editor features, see the "ScreenMan" section in the
*VA FileMan User Manual*.

Delete a Form
-------------

As a final step in the tutorial, you can delete your test form.

To delete a form, do the following:

1.  Use the Delete a Form option, which is on the same menu (ScreenMan)
    > as the Edit/Create a Form and Run a Form options.

2.  Select the form to be deleted. When you choose a form to delete with
    > the Delete a Form option, it lists all blocks on the form, noting
    > whether or *not* the blocks are used on any other form.

![Note](images/media/image2.png){width="0.3125in" height="0.3125in"}
**NOTE:** None of the blocks you have used in this tutorial should be
part of any other form.

3.  The option asks whether to delete all "deletable" blocks on your
    > form. For the form you have built for this tutorial, you should
    > answer **YES**.

4.  The option then deletes your form and all "deletable" blocks on your
    > form.

Appendix A---M Code and Variables in ScreenMan Forms
====================================================

M code in Field Properties
--------------------------

You can enter M code for the following field properties:

-   Branching Logic

-   Pre Action

-   Post Action

-   Post Action on Change

-   Data Validation

The M code for these properties can rely on the variables listed in
[Table 6]{.underline}, which are being defined by ScreenMan:

[]{#_Ref390254704 .anchor}Table . ScreenMan-defined M Code Variables

  Variable   Description
  ---------- -------------------------------------------
  X          The current internal value of the field.
  DDSEXT     The current external value of the field.
  DDSOLD     The previous internal value of the field.

You can also enter M code in a field's Executable Caption and Executable
Default properties, but you *cannot* depend on the X, DDSEXT, or DDSOLD
variables.

Variables
---------

### DDSBR Variable

ScreenMan allows you to conditionally branch the user to a field. This
can be done with M code in the:

-   Branching Logic

-   Pre Action

-   Post Action

-   Post Action on Change properties at the field-level

-   Data Validation property at the form-level

The M code should set the DDSBR variable to the location of the field to
which you wish to take the user. The DDSBR variable should be set in the
following format:

Field ID\^Block ID\^Page ID"

Where:

  Piece      Value
  ---------- ----------------------------------------------------------------
  Field ID   Caption of field, Unique Name of field, or Field Order number.
  Block ID   Block Order number or Block Name.
  Page ID    Page Number or Page Name.

For example:

S:X="Y" DDSBR="FIELD 1\^BLOCK 1\^PAGE 2"

This takes the user to the field with unique name or caption "FIELD 1"
on the block named "BLOCK 1" on the page named "PAGE 2", if the internal
value of the field = Y.

### DDSSTACK Variable

The DDSSTACK variable can be set only in the Branching Logic property of
a field. It can be used to branch users to another page when they press
**Enter** at the field. After the user closes the page defined in
DDSSTACK, ScreenMan takes the user back to the parent page, to the field
*immediately* following the field from which the branch occurred.

For example, set DDSSTACK equal to the Page Number or Page Name:

S:X="Y" DDSSTACK="Page 1.1"

This takes the user to Page 1.1 if the internal value of the field is
"Y" and the user presses **Enter** at the field. When Page 1.1 is
closed, the user returns to the parent page, to the field *immediately*
following the field from which the branch occurred.

ScreenMan provides another way to achieve this kind of "branch and
return" behavior. You can link a field to a subpage by defining a
Subpage Link for the field or by defining a Parent Field for the
subpage. The Subpage Link and Parent Field methods, however, do *not*
allow branching conditionally.

Other Places for M Code in Forms
--------------------------------

Besides the field-level, you can use M code at the following levels:

-   Form

-   Page

-   Block

[Table 7]{.underline} lists the levels in a form that you can use M code
in property fields:

[]{#_Ref390255301 .anchor}Table . Form Levels Used M code in Property
Fields

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| Level                             | Property Fields                   |
+===================================+===================================+
| Form                              | Pre Action, Post Action, Data     |
|                                   | Validation, or Post Save.         |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| Page                              | Pre Action or Post Action.        |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| Block                             | Pre Action or Post Action (stored |
|                                   | in the FORM file \[\#.403\]       |
|                                   | only).                            |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Pre Action or Post Action (stored |
|                                   | in the BLOCK file \[\#.404\]).    |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

Validating Data
---------------

ScreenMan uses the definition of a field to automatically validate
values inputted by the user. You can use the **Data Validation**
property of a field to validate the value even further.

Data Validation is M code that is executed *after* a user enters a new
value for a field and *after* the automatic validation that ScreenMan
normally performs. If the M code sets the DDSERROR variable, ScreenMan
rejects the value. You might also want to ring the bell and make a call
to HLP\^DDSUTL to display a message to the user that indicates the
reason the value was rejected.
